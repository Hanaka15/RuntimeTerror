# 🐛 Runtime Terror 🚨  
*"Because what’s coding without a little chaos?"*

---

## 👾 Who Are We?  
We are **Runtime Terror**, a team of elite (or so we like to think) coders who thrive under pressure, laugh in the face of compiler errors, and occasionally cause catastrophic program crashes (on purpose, of course). Our mission? To make the runtime *scream* and the bugs *run for their lives*.  

---

## 🤔 What Do We Do?  
- **Write Code**: Occasionally coherent. Sometimes commented. Rarely bug-free.  
- **Smash Bugs**: With a combination of skill, luck, and ritual sacrifices to the Debug God.  
- **Break Things**: Accidentally, intentionally, and everything in between.  
- **Repeat**: Until it *works* (or the coffee runs out).

## 🎯 Our Motto  
> "It works on my machine."

## 📜 Core Values  
1. **Code First, Fix Later**  
2. **Ctrl+Z is Life**  
3. **Debugging: Where we spend 90% of our time and 100% of our sanity**  
4. **Commit Messages are Optional (But Despair is Not)**  

---

## 🚀 How We Work  
1. **Step 1**: Write the code.  
2. **Step 2**: Run the code.  
3. **Step 3**: Watch the code explode in runtime terror.  
4. **Step 4**: Debug for hours, fix it, and then introduce 3 new bugs.  
5. **Step 5**: Celebrate like we just cured cancer when it finally works.

---

## 🛠 Tools of the Trade  
- **Git**: For arguing over merge conflicts.  
- **Stack Overflow**: Because we definitely didn’t know that one obscure function existed.  
- **Rubber Duck**: The one true debugging companion.  
- **Coffee**: The blood of coders.

## 🐾 Fun Fact  
Our team name is inspired by the terror we feel every time we hit **Run** and stare at the console, waiting to see if it works... or if we’re about to rewrite everything at 3 AM.
